        for v6.1, but will not be supported for v7.


Compatibility Issues For Existing FLEXlm Companies
__________________________________________________

        There is one minor compatibility issue, which may affect
        ISV internal testsuites.  Upon successful checkout, the
        license file location used for the checkout is stored and
        remembered for all future checkouts for products using the same
        vendor daemon.

        Therefore, for existing FLEXlm ISVs, a checkout may be attempted
        with an unexpected license or license server.  See
        "REGISTRY and $HOME/.flexlmrc" below.

        This can be disabled in 3 ways:

                1) Set the environment variable FLEXLM_NO_CKOUT_INSTALL_LIC
                   to 1.  This can be set in the environment, or on windows
                   in the FLEXlm registry, or on unix in $HOME.flexlmrc.

                2) In lm_code.h, change
                        #define LM_VER_BEHAVIOR LM_BEHAVIOR_V7
                   to
                        #define LM_VER_BEHAVIOR LM_BEHAVIOR_V6

                3) or call

                        lc_set_attr(job, LM_A_CKOUT_INSTALL_LIC,
                                                        (LM_A_VAL_TYPE)0);

        We recommend that this not be disabled, but testsuites may
        behave unexpectedly with this enhancement.

FLEXlm V7.0 Enhancements
_________________________


        Licenses improved for E-Mailing
        _______________________________

        Many e-mailers insert newlines in licenses.  v7 now
        handles this correctly.  You can still use licenses
        directly from e-mail, without removing the email headers.

        Licenses are more strict about requiring '#' at the beginning
        of a line in certain cases:  If a comment appears immediately after
        a valid FLEXlm line, it should begin with a '#'.  Otherwise,
        FLEXlm may interpret the comment as being part of the preceding
        line.

        Examples:

        GOOD LICENSE:
                From lpichotta@earthlink.net Fri Aug  7 17:06:47 1998
                Received: from mail1.globes.com
                Received: (from uucp@localhost)
                          by mail1.globes.com (8.8.4/8.8.4)

                SERVER license_server 12345678
                VENDOR xyzd
                # Here is a comment
                FEATURE f1 xyzd 1.0 permanent 4 1F0E784111C6
                # Here is another comment

        PROBLEM LICENSE:
                SERVER license_server 12345678
                VENDOR xyzd
                Here is a comment
                FEATURE f1 xyzd 1.0 permanent 4 1F0E784111C6
                Here is another comment

            There are 2 minor problems with this.
            FLEXlm understands this file as follows:

                SERVER license_server 12345678
                VENDOR xyzd Here is a comment
                FEATURE f1 xyzd 1.0 permanent 4 1F0E784111C6 Here is \
                        another comment

            It therefore interprets the VENDOR line as:

                Here: path to vendor daemon
                is:   path to options file
                a:    port number for vendor daemon to run on

            The log file will complain about these, but, as long as
            xyzd is in the $PATH, the vendor daemon will run fine.

            With the FEATURE line, the additional words are
            ignored if the checkout succeeds.  If not, the
            error printed refers to the additional text as being
            possibly from a future version of FLEXlm that it doesn't
            understand:

                Future license file format or misspelling in license file

            These problems are prevented by beginning comments
            with a '#'.

        Other licenses E-Mailing improvements
        _____________________________________

        On Windows, it's easy to rename a file called license.dat to
        license.dat.txt without realizing it.  v7 now automatically
        finds such files when this occurs.


        lmstrip now supported on windows
        ________________________________

        Companies that ship libraries (*.lib) that make FLEXlm function
        calls need lmstrip, for 2 reasons:

                1) For security, so that customers can't replace
                   lmgr.lib with a dummy library that will resolve
                   necessary links, but disable licensing, and
                2) So that a customer can do their own FLEXlm licensing
                   in a binary that links your FLEXlm library.  Otherwise,
                   a conflict can occur.

        Usage:
                C:> copy lmgr.lib mylmgr.lib
                C:> lmstrip -r -m mylmgr.lib
                C:> lib mylmgr.lib
                C:> lmstrip -r -m myfuncs.lib
                C:> lib myfuncs.lib

        With -m, lmstrip creates a "mapfile" which contains a
        lookup table of randomized symbol names which is reused
        later for other object or library files, ensuring the
        names are mapped identically.  For example, "lc_checkout"
        may be renamed to "xLfH3C".  If this happens in 2 separate
        object files, the renaming must be identical.

        You can now safely ship mylmgr.lib and myfuncs.lib to
        your customers.  When your customer links their object
        with myfuncs.lib and mylmgr.lib, everything is resolved
        and functions correctly.  And the temptation to alter
        the libraries and/or functions is reduced since the
        function names are not meaningful.

        The default mapfile name is "lmstrip.map".  "-mapfile filename"
        can be used to override this, where 'filename' is the new
        mapfile name.


        REGISTRY and $HOME/.flexlmrc
        ____________________________

        On Windows all FLEXlm environment variables can be specified
        in the Registry in
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\FLEXlm License Manager\LM_LICENSE_FILE

        and

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\FLEXlm License Manager\VENDOR_LICENSE_FILE

        where "VENDOR" is your vendor daemon name.

        On Unix, you can specify these variables in $HOME/.flexlm.
        For example, $LM_LICENSE_FILE can be set thus:

        __________________________________________________________
        % cat ~/.flexlmrc
        LM_LICENSE_FILE = /u/product/licenses
        __________________________________________________________

        In addition, upon successful checkout, FLEXlm automatically sets
        $VENDOR_LICENSE_FILE in the registry (Windows) or .flexlmrc
        (Unix).

        License sorting
        _______________

        Licenses lines are sorted automatically, to avoid problems that
        can occur through FEATURE ordering.  This feature can be overridden
        by using the "sort=nnn" attribute, as noted below.

        The automatic ordering accomplishes the following enhancements:

                1) Uncounted licenses are tried before counted licenses.
                   Users will obtain uncounted licenses wherever possible
                   before using a counted license.
                2) More recent feature/increment lines are used
                   before older lines.  This avoids the problem with
                   FEATURE lines where the user adds a new FEATURE line
                   at the end of the file, but this remains ununused by
                   the license server, which ignores all but the first
                   FEATURE line for a given feature name.
                3) FEATURE lines are seen by the server before INCREMENT lines
                   for the same feature.  Otherwise, the FEATURE line is
                   ignored.
                4) Files are not broken up.  This way, the order of
                   license files as indicated in LM_A_LICENSE_DEFAULT,
                   $LM_LICENSE_FILE and $VENDOR_LICENSE_FILE are still
                   honored.

        To override this order, the end-user (or ISV) can add "sort=100"
        to all FEATURE/ INCREMENT lines.  Valid sort values are from 1
        to 200.  Lower appear earlier than higher numbers.  All lines
        with the same sort value retain the order they have in the
        license file.  sort=nnn is not computed into the license key,
        so it can be changed by anyone without reissuing the license.


        USING FLEXlock Functionality
        ____________________________

        FLEXlock is a new feature in FLEXlm designed to make it extremely easy
        to add "try before you buy" licensing to a product that uses FLEXlm.
        After enabling FLEXlock in a FLEXlm licensed product,  FLEXlock
        automatically allows a trial period after the initial installation
        along with explanatory warnings and dialogs explaining the evaluation
        system to the user.  At the completion of the trial period, the user
        has the option to either stop using or purchase the product. Upon
        purchasing, the user is given a license file that will enable your
        product to run in a normal FLEXlm manner.  During the evaluation period
        it is possible to detect if the user has made unlicensed copies.

        To use the FLEXlock functionality you need to:

                1.  Enable the functionality in your program.

                2.  Determine the operation and parameters of the "try before
                        you buy" functionality.

                3.  Run "flsetup.exe" to define these FLEXlock parameters
                        and create the FLEXlock distribution file "fldata.ini".


        Enabling the FLEXlock Features
       ______________________________

        To enable the functionality of the FLEXlock you will need to specify
        to FLEXlm that you will be permitting this functionality.

        If you are using the TRIVIAL or SIMPLE API's of FLEXLM, you will simply
        specify an additional License Policy of LM_FLEXLOCK to your checkout
        call.

        i.e.
        CHECKOUT(LM_RESTRICTIVE | LM_FLEXLOCK, "myfeature", "1.0",
                         "license.dat"  )

        If you are using the FLEXible API, you will need to add a lc_set_attr
        call,

                lc_set_attr ( lm_job, LM_A_FLEXLOCK , 1 );

        NOTE:  We've made every effort to make the FLEXlock feature secure.
        However, due to the type of security technology used for FLEXlock,
        it is less secure than the rest of FLEXlm.  This is why it is disabled
        by default.  You should only enable FLEXLOCK if the convenience of
        FLEXlock licensing is more important than the reduced security it
        exposes your product to.

        For additional security, each time that your application is installed,
        and the user activates the FLEXlock operation, a random id number is
        generated.  This number can be used to identify work done with your
        application in this mode.  If this number is saved in the work, and
        compared when accessing it, you may be able to  determine if your
        application has been re-installed.

        You can obtain this number by calling

        short code_id;
                lc_get_attr(job, LM_A_FLEXLOCK_INSTALL_ID, ( short * )
                                         &code_id );

        After the FLEXlock operation is activated, an entry is generated in the
        registry.  It is located at:

          HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->SOFTWARE->GLOBEtrotter Software Inc.->FLEXlock

        A subkey for each feature is located inside the FLEXlock subkey and
        is a combination of the vendor name and the feature name.  If this
        subkey is deleted, the program will act as if you had never activated
        the FLEXlock functionality.  (Familiarity with the registry editor is
        necessary for testing FLEXlock enabled features.)


        The FLEXlock Configuration Editor
       _________________________________

        To define the operation of FLEXlock features, you must run the
        flsetup.exe program and generate the "fldata.ini" file.

        Flsetup.exe allows developers to quickly define:

        The type of product trial including:
                - fixed number of days
                - fixed numbers of executions
                - expiration on a fixed date

        How to behave when the trial expires:
                - don't run
                - run with a warning

        The greeting given when the product is first executed
        The greeting given during the trial phase
        The message given when the trial phase expires including
                instructions on how to purchase the product

        Product's Attributes:
                - product name
                - company name
                - copyright notice

        After configuring these parameters and saving the file, run the
        "File->Create Distribution Files".  This generates the fldata.ini file
        that will need to be shipped with the product.  Also the flcflxA.dll
        file will need to be shipped with the product as well.  These files
        should be placed in the same directory as your program executable.


        LCM - License Certificate Manager
       _________________________________

        FLEXlock has been designed to work with GLOBEtrotter's LCM, so software
        vendors may have a fully automated try-before-you-buy program,
        coupled to a web-based unlocking and payment system.
        With the use of Globetrack Licensing, it is possible to obtain a
        license file over the internet, and have it automatically installed
        without user intervention of copying and pasting.


       Enabling and using LCM
       ______________________

        To enable the LCM automated license installer:

                lc_set_attr(job, LM_A_LCM, (LM_A_VAL_TYPE)1);

        Note:   This enabled by default.

        To change the default URL for the LCM.

                lc_set_attr(job, LM_A_LCM_URL,
                    (LM_A_VAL_TYPE)"www.mycompany.com/licenses");

        Note: By default this value is is "www.globetrotter.com/vendorname"
        where vendorname is your vendor daemon name.


        Intel Pentium III CPUID (v7.0d+)
        ________________________________
        
        The Intel Pentium hostid is supported, but only on systems using
        Pentium III.  We believe this hostid is more secure than any
        other FLEXlm hostids, especially on windows, so where available
        it's the preferred hostid for Windows/NT.

        We support it in 3 formats: 96, 64 and 32-bit.

        The hostid itself is 96 bit, and looks like:

                XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

        Intel claims that the 96-bit id will be unique, with some
        possible rare exceptions due to chips flaws.  However, the
        64-bit and 32-bit versions should also be very nearly unique,
        although according to Intel, duplicates will likely occur with
        these versions.  Duplicates are not likely in any given chip
        batch, so we would expect that systems built from chips from
        a given factory over a short period of time would have a high
        probability of being unique.

        The 32-bit version is the last 9 characters from the 96-bit
        hostid, and the 64-bit version is the last 19 characters.

        For example:

        % lmhostid -cpu96 -n
        1111-2222-3333-4444-5555-6666
        % lmhostid -cpu64 -n
        3333-4444-5555-6666
        % lmhostid -cpu32 -n
        5555-6666
        % lmhostid -cpu -n
        5555-6666

        We recommend using the 32-bit format, but if you require 
        strict uniqueness for the hostids then you should use the
        96-bit.  The 64-bit version should be more unique than the
        32-bit version.

        How to enable the Intel Pentium III CPUID
        _________________________________________

        This feature is shipped turned off from the factory.  This is
        turned on using the BIOS Setup, which is usually entered by 
        hitting the DEL key during bootup.

        How to read the CPUID
        _________________________________________

        lmhostid -cpu:                  32-bit CPUID
        lmhostid -cpu32:                32-bit CPUID
        lmhostid -cpu64:                64-bit CPUID
        lmhostid -cpu96:                96-bit CPUID

        lmtools.exe shows the 96-bit version.  


Other v7.0 Changes
__________________

        Enhanced 3-server Redundant Server Reliability
        ______________________________________________

        The reliability of 3-server configuration is improved, particularly
        when the master node becomes disconnected.


        Windows: "set FLEXLM_BATCH=1" turns off prompts
        _______________________________________________

        When set, error messages are directed to stderr, so they
        are not lost when programs are run in batch.   The programmer
        has always had the ability to turn these off, but now
        the end-user can do it if the programmer didn't think of it.
        It is still strongly recommended that the programmer turn
        off prompts so that the end-user doesn't have to set an
        environment variable to correctly use the product.

        In addition, this can be set programmatically using:

                lc_set_attr(job, LM_A_PERROR_MSGBOX, (LM_A_VAL_TYPE)0);
                lc_set_attr(job, LM_A_PROMPT_FOR_FILE, (LM_A_VAL_TYPE)0);


        Windows: Process ID now full ID and in hex
        __________________________________________

        FLEXlm refers to process ids in various places.  In the
        past these were sometimes incorrect, and sometimes truncated.
        They're now full process ids in hex, as Windows displays them.


        RESERVE PROJECT
        _______________

        You can now reserve for a project.  The project is specified
        by the client's $LM_PROJECT environment variable.


        Improved RESERVE reporting
        __________________________

        Previously, if 'n' licenses were RESERVEd in the options file,
        'n' messages were produced in both the lmgrd debug log and lmstat -a
        output.  In the worst case, if for example 100 licenses were reserved,
        100 messages would be printed.  Now a single message is printed.


        lmreread, lmdown now take -all
        ______________________________

        lmdown -all will automatically shutdown all lmgrd servers
        it finds.  Otherwise, if there are more than one lmgrd running,
        it requires the user to specify which one to shutdown.

        Similarly lmreread -all will tell all lmgrd processes to
        reread their license files.

        lmdown -all implies lmdown -q.


        lmutil now takes "-e file"
        __________________________

        lmutil and all lm* utilities can now redirect stderr to a
        file using "-e file."


        Improved DLL support -- LM_A_WINDOWS_MODULE_HANDLE
        __________________________________________________

        If your application links the FLEXlm static library into
        your DLL, then you need to set this new attribute:
        LM_A_WINDOWS_MODULE_HANDLE.  After lc_new_job() and
        before lc_checkout(), you should call:

                lc_set_attr(job, LM_A_WINDOWS_MODULE_HANDLE, (LM_A_VAL_TYPE)
                        GetModuleHandle(dllname));

        where dllname is the name of your DLL.  Otherwise, the
        FLEXlm installation dialog won't work, and the lc_checkout
        call will fail with the new error code LM_NORESLINK.


v7.0 Changes from Previous versions
___________________________________

        VENDOR_LICENSE_FILE automatically set
        _____________________________________

        Upon successful checkout, $VENDOR_LICENSE_FILE is automatically
        set for the user.  This is done via the registry on Windows
        and ~/.flexlmrc on Unix.  This can be disabled via

                lc_set_attr(job, LM_A_CKOUT_INSTALL_LIC, (LM_A_VAL_TYPE)0);

        or by setting the behavior in lm_code.h to V6.

        This can also be disabled with the environment variable
        FLEXLM_NO_CKOUT_INSTALL_LIC.


        makekey.exe no longer prompts for SPX port number
        _________________________________________________

        Instead use -spx_port on the command line.  This is now supported
        on Unix also.  makekey behaves the same on Unix as on windows now.
