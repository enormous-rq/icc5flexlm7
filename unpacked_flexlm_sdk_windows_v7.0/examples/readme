THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS UNSUPPORTED PROGRAMS, AND THESE PROGRAMS MAY NOT
EXIST ON FUTURE FLEXlm DISTRIBUTION KITS.

This directory contains several example program directories.  These 
programs are intended to provide instruction in the use of various 
FLEXlm features.  

While we have made every effort to insure that these examples are 
correct, they are not intended to be release-quality debugged 
products.  In other words, USE THESE EXAMPLES AT YOUR OWN RISK! 

For developers new to FLEXlm, please read Chapters 1-3 of the 
Programmers Guide.  For introductory source code examples, please use 
lmclient.c (Trivial API), lmsimple.c (Simple API) and lmflex.c 
(FLEXible API).  To build these introductory examples, cd to
the binary directory for your system (for example, ../sun4_u5)
and type 

	% make lmclient 
	% make lmsimple
	% make lmflex

Other directories:

	licenses -- 	Examples licenses, useful for lmcrypt

Advanced examples provided include:

	child -- 	Child process which checks out a license and 
			communicates status with parent.  Optional 
                        encryption of traffic with parent.  A 
                        possible solution for Unix programs that 
                        cannot use SIGALRM, but need regular 
                        heartbeats.

	vendor_hostid - Example of vendor-defined hostid code.
