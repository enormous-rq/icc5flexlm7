<H1>Q4.     License File Locations</H1>
<HR>
<A NAME="Q4.1"></A>
<H2>Q4.1  My application can't seem to find the license file. What do I do? </H2>
<P>
Applications find the license file in one of 3 places:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>A location specified in the application by the vendor. See the application manual for this 
location. 
</LI>
<LI>$LM_LICENSE_FILE (including VMS and Windows/NT). In UNIX, this can also be a colon-separated list (like $PATH) of license files, so that this environment variable can be set 
once for all applications. In Windows, you use a semicolon-seperated list.</LI>
</OL>
<A NAME="Q4.2"></A>
<H2>Q4.2  lmstat doesn't report all the features in my license file. Why? </H2>
<P>
Here's the possibilities:</P>
<OL>
<LI>$LM_LICENSE_FILE is set to the wrong file.</LI>
<LI>lmstat doesn't report on<A NAME="IX23"> 'uncounted' features</A>. These are features with a 'number of 
licenses' field set to '0' or uncounted (v6+). 'Number of licenses' is the 6th item on a FEATURE line (after 
the expiration date). There's nothing to report on uncounted features. NOTE: v5.+ of 
FLEXlm provides the option of having servers service 'uncounted' features, in 
which case lmstat will report these also.</LI>
</OL>
<A NAME="Q4.3"></A>
<H2>Q4.3  I've received FLEXlm license files from 2 different companies. Do I have to combine them? </H2>
<P>
You don't have to combine license files. Each license file that has any 'counted' lines (the 
 'number of licenses' field is &gt;0) requires a server. It's perfectly OK to have any number of 
separate license files, with different lmgrd server processes supporting each file. Moreover, 
since lmgrd is a lightweight process, for sites without system administrators, this is often the 
simplest (and therefore recommended) way to proceed. 
<A NAME="Q4.4"></A></P>
<H2>Q4.4  I want to combine license files. How do I do it?</H2>
<P>
Pre v6:<BR>
Only license files with identical hostids on the SERVER line can be <A NAME="IX22">combined</A>. Note that license 
files may refer to the same host using different hostids, particularly on hp700, where one file 
may use ethernet hostid, and another uname -i. In this case these license files CANNOT be 
combined because the hostids are not identical. 
</P>
<P>
If the hostids are identical, concatenate the 2 files, and then remove identical SERVER lines, so 
there's only one (or three for redundant servers) SERVER line(s). It's then strongly 
recommended that symbolic links be made from the new, merged file to the old file locations. 
That way, the applications will be able to find the newly merged file without having to change 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, make sure you use the latest version of lmgrd on the merged file. The FLEXlm version 
of lmgrd MUST be &gt;= the FLEXlm version of the vendor daemon (noted on the DAEMON 
line). Use lmver to determine the FLEXlm version of the vendor daemon or lmgrd. (The patch 
letters at the end of the version are not significant when comparing versions for this purpose.) 
</P>
<P>

v6+:<BR>
If all FLEXlm computers are v6+, you can set the $LM_LICENSE_FILE to a directory (or the application may have already specified this). Then all files named <I>*.lic</I> in that directory are automatically read as if they were combined.
<A NAME="Q4.5"></A></P>
<H2>Q4.5  When is it recommended to combine license files?</H2>
<P>
 Many system administrators, especially for larger sites, prefer to combine license files to ease 
administration of FLEXlm licenses. It's purely a matter of preference.
<A NAME="Q4.6"></A></P>
<H2>Q4.6  How do I set the location of the license file with an Environment Variable?</H2>
<P>
You can set either <A NAME="IX21">LM_LICENSE_FILE</A> or <I>VENDOR</I>_LICENSE_FILE(v6+). <BR>
Where <I>VENDOR</I> is the vendor daemon name in all uppercase(e.g., GSI_LICENSE_FILE).
</P>
<DL>
<DT>In UNIX:</DT>
<DD> % setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE <I>license_file_path</I></DD>
<DT>In Windows 3.1 and 95/98:</DT>
<DD><I>edit</I> autoexec.bat</DD>
<DD><I>type</I> SET LM_LICENSE_FILE=<I>license_file_path</I></DD>
<DT>In Windows NT:</DT>
<DD>In the Control Panel &quot;System icon&quot; change global environment by adding LM_LICENSE_FILE with <I>license_file_path</I></DD>
