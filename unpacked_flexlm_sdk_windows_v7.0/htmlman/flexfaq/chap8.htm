<H1>Q8.     Redundant Servers </H1>
<HR>
<A NAME="Q8.1"></A>
<H2>Q8.1  What are FLEXlm <A NAME="IX50">redundant servers</A>? </H2>
<P>
There's 2 kind of redundancy available through FLEXlm: true redundant servers, and use license-file list with $LM_LICENSE_FILE. 
</P>
<P>
Redundant servers are a set of 3 nodes designated to serve the same license file. The license file 
has 3 SERVER lines. lmgrd is started on all 3 nodes. One of the servers starts out as the master 
server and serves licenses. If the master goes down, another server takes over as master. 
Redundant servers require a quorum of 2 servers to be up, or no licenses are served. 
</P>
<P>
With $LM_LICENSE_FILE list redundancy, each one of a group of license servers 
serves a subset of the total licenses. The end-user sets LM_LICENSE_FILE to a list of 
license files, where each license file refers to one of the license servers. The application 
then tries each server in the list, in order, until it succeeds or gets to the end of the list.
<A NAME="Q8.2"></A></P>
<H2>Q8.2  How do I start up redundant servers? Is there a time-limit for starting all the servers? </H2>
<P>
There is no time limit. Simply start the servers as convenient. The first server started of the first 
2 listed in the license file becomes the master. For example, 

</P>
<PRE>SERVER node1 12345678 2937</PRE>

<PRE>SERVER node2 55489789 2937</PRE>

<PRE>SERVER node3 87564543 2937</PRE>
<P>
The first to start of node1 or node2 becomes the master. node3 is never the master - it's there 
only to maintain quorum. 
<A NAME="Q8.3"></A></P>
<H2>Q8.3  Why is a <A NAME="IX51">quorum </A>of 2 servers required?</H2>
<P>
Without a quorum, you could easily steal licenses. Here's how: request licenses from redundant 
servers for 3 nodes each of which are on separate networks. Start each of the 3 nodes. If quorum 
is not required, they'll each become master, and 3 times the number of licenses purchased will 
be available. With quorum, this is impossible. 
<A NAME="Q8.4"></A></P>
<H2>Q8.4  When are redundant servers recommended? </H2>
<P>
For mission critical applications where there's a system administrator available. A good 
example is a Wall Street trading floor, where a lost server can mean a lost trade. 
</P>
<P>
The reason an administrator is recommended is the following: since a quorum of 2 servers is 
required, when one server goes down, there are suddenly 2 points of failure. That is, with 2 
servers up, if EITHER goes down, licenses are denied. In this state, the mathematical reliability 
of the system is twice as bad as it would be WITHOUT redundant servers, where only one of 
those 2 nodes would cause failure. Therefore, it's the administrators job to detect when any of 
the 3 servers are down, and bring it back up as soon as possible. This job is made easier with 
FLEXadmin, where detection is automatic. </P>
<A NAME="Q8.5"></A>
<H2>Q8.5  What hosts should be used for 3-server redundant servers?</H2>
<P>
The servers can be mixed platforms: NT, Sun, etc. So, the 3 servers can consist of NT, Sun and 
HP. The only important thing is that they be reliable and that they have excellent and reliable 
communications between the 3 systems. The latter requirement is because the servers send 
periodic heartbeats to each other, and if these heartbeats fail, the servers may have blackout 
periods, and are generally less reliable. Therefore, placing servers geographically far apart, or 
in different subnets or domains, is discouraged.</P>
<A NAME="Q8.6"></A>
<H2>Q8.6  When are redundant servers discouraged?</H2>
<OL>
<LI>At sites without system administrators.</LI>
<LI>When the software relies on a single host. In this case, there's a single point of failure, 
and redundant FLEXlm servers only complicates administration and does not add any 
redundancy to the overall system. 
</LI>
</OL>
<A NAME="Q8.7"></A>
<H2>Q8.7  Is it OK to NFS-mount license files when using redundant servers?</H2>
<P>
If the license file is located only on one node, the redundancy is being defeated. That is, there's 
a single point of failure, and the redundant servers only complicate administration. 
<A NAME="Q8.8"></A></P>
<H2>Q8.8  How can the <A NAME="IX52">license-file list</A> in $LM_LICENSE_FILE be used for redundancy? </H2>
<P>
Suppose a customer wants 20 licenses for feature 'f1'. The license distributor can ship 2 license 
files for 10 licenses each of 'f1', each with one SERVER line, for 2 different hostids. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
File 1:</P>
<PRE>SERVER node1 12345678 2837</PRE>

<PRE>DAEMON demo /usr/local/flexlm/demo</PRE>

<PRE>FEATURE f1...</PRE>
<P>
File 2:
</P>
<PRE>SERVER node2 87654321 2837</PRE>

<PRE>DAEMON demo /usr/local/flexlm/demo</PRE>

<PRE>FEATURE f1...</PRE>
<P>
The user sets LM_LICENSE_FILE to file1:file2 (or 2837@node1:2837@node2). When a 
checkout for f1 is attempted it first attempts a checkout from node1. If this fails for any reason, 
a checkout is attempted from node2. 
</P>
<P>
For PC:</P>
<P>
Use `,' (comma) instead of `:' to separate license paths. As of v5 (available Q1, 1996), the 
comma will change to `;' (semi-colon).
<A NAME="Q8.9"></A></P>
<H2>Q8.9  Are there any drawbacks to using the license-file list for redundancy? </H2>
<P>
Yes. By default, once an application has successfully checked out a license from one host, all 
subsequent checkouts must be satisfied from the same host. If the application requires more than 
one FEATURE, then this could result in a license denial when the license may be available on 
another server. An application can bypass this restriction with the use of multiple FLEXlm 
`license jobs', but in practice, few applications do at this time.
</P>
<P>
If the application supports license queueing, all licenses are only queued from the first host on 
the list. 
<A NAME="Q8.10"></A></P>
<H2>Q8.10  When is it recommended to use license-file list for redundancy rather than true redundant servers? </H2>
<P>
When there's less system administration available to monitor license servers, when the 
applications are not mission- critical, and for WAN's. The license-file list has some other advantages: it's 
more forgiving if you lose quorum; it's not limited to 3 servers (any number will work); and for 
wide-area networks, you can make servers available locally, with remote servers available as 
backup.
