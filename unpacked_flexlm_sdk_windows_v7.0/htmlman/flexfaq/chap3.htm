<H1>Q3.     FLEXlm Versions</H1>
<HR>

<A NAME="Q3.1"></A>
<H2>Q3.1  How do I tell what version I'm using? </H2>
<P>
Use lmutil <A NAME="IX16">'lmver'</A> command. Also you can use '-v', after a utility command to print the version. <BR>
For example, lmutil lmdiag -v.
</P>
<P>In Windows, you can click on FLEXlm License Manager icon in the Control Panel. Then look under the &quot;Diagnostics&quot; tab and click on the &quot;Version&quot; button.
<A NAME="Q3.2"></A></P>
<H2>Q3.2  I have products from several companies at various FLEXlm version levels. Do I have to worry about how these versions work together? </H2>
<P>
If you're not combining license files from different vendors, the simplest thing to do is to run them separately making 
sure you use the tools (especially lmgrd and the vendor daemon) that are shipped by each vendor. 
</P>
<P>
Lmgrd will always correctly support older versions of vendor daemons and applications, so it's 
ALWAYS safe to use the latest version of lmgrd. If you've combined license files rom 2 
vendors, you MUST use the latest version of lmgrd. 
</P>
<P>

If you've received 2 versions of a product from the same vendor, you MUST use the latest 
vendor daemon they send you. An older vendor daemon with a newer client may cause 
communication errors.</P>
<P>

Please ignore letters appended to FLEXlm versions, i.e., v2.4d. The appended letter indicates a 
patch, and does NOT indicate any compatibility differences. In particular, some elements of 
FLEXlm didn't require certain patches, so a 2.4 lmgrd can work successfully with a 2.4b vendor 
daemon. 
<A NAME="Q3.3"></A></P>
<H2>Q3.3  I've received a new copy of a product from a vendor, and it uses a new version of FLEXlm. Is my old license file still valid?</H2>
<P>
Yes. Older FLEXlm license files are always valid with newer versions of FLEXlm. 
<A NAME="Q3.4"></A></P>
<H2>Q3.4  I've received a new license file, and the format is different from the old one I had from the same vendor? Why? Are they compatible?</H2>
<P>
As of v3.0, FLEXlm has an optional new format for license files. FLEXlm products always understand older versions; therefore, the pre-v3.0 files are 
understood by every FLEXlm version. However, your old applications (pre-FLEXlm v3.0) will 
not be able to use the new license file.  Read Chapter 5, for more about License File Contents. 
<A NAME="Q3.5"></A></P>
<H2>Q3.5  Does FLEXlm handle dates in the year 2000 and beyond?</H2>
<P>
Yes, every version of FLEXlm handles<A NAME="IX17"> year 2000</A>. The FLEXlm date format uses a 4-digit year. Dates in the 20th century (19xx) can be 
abbreviated to the last 2 digits of the year (xx), and use of this feature is quite widespread. Dates 
in the year 2000 and beyond must specify all 4 year digits. Note that the year `0' or `00' is a 
special case, and does not mean 1900. Rather it means that the license never expires.</P>
