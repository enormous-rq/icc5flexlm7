<title>FLEXlm Frequently Asked Questions: Q13.     WINDOWS/PC Related Questions</title>
<h1>Q13.     WINDOWS/PC Related Questions</h1><hr>
<a name="Q13.1"></a><h2>Q13.1  What Platforms does the PC Run on?</h2>
<p>
Flex LM supports the following platforms:<p>
<ul><li>Windows 3.11<li>Windows for Workgroup 3.11<li>Windows 95/98<li>Windows NT 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0<li>Alpha NT 3.51<li>Netware 3.12 and 4.X</ul><p>
Networking is required only for floating/concurrent use licenses<p>
<a name="Q13.2"></a><h2>Q13.2  What is WINSOCKX.DLL</h2>
<p>
Winsockx.dll is a dll provided by Globetrotter that is used by 16 bit applications to interface 
between Flexlm and other networking software provided by networking ISV's. It allows 
nodelocked applications to not require networking software. It also interfaces between 
winsock.dll for TCP/IP, and the Novell dll's that provide IPX/SPX on 16 bit operating systems.<p>
<a name="Q13.3"></a><h2>Q13.3  Will the Server run on Windows 95/98?</h2>
<p>
Since v6+, it is possible to run the Flexlm Server (LMGRD.exe and vendor.exe) in a 
window. This is not as good of a solution as a NT where it can be run as a service. Further testing 
will be undertaken to verify its operation, but there is no reason not to test the server on a 
Windows 95/98 system.<p>
<a name="Q13.4"></a><h2>Q13.4  How do I start the Server in Windows?</h2>
<p>
You can start lmgrd.exe in 2 places.  
<ul><dt>1. Control Panel - Flexlm License Manager Icon - <I>click on </I>Start.
 <dt>Make sure you have correct paths for "lmgrd.exe" and "license.dat"
<p><dt>2. MS-DOS prompt - <I>type</I> lmgrd -app -c license_file_path.</ul>
<a name="Q13.5"></a><h2>Q13.5 Can the Server automatically startup when I power-up my PC?</h2>
<p>
Yes, you can use "FLEXlm License Manager" icon in the Control Panel to startup the Server at power-up. For Windows check on "Start Server at Power-Up".  On NT also check on "NT Services".
