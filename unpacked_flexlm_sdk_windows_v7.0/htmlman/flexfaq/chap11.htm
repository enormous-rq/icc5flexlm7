<H1>Q11.     FLEXlm utilities (<A NAME="IX58">lmutil</A> - lmstat, etc.) </H1>
<HR>
<P>
PC NOTE: On all platforms, the utilities can be invoked with the 
lmutil command: 
lmutil lmstat, 
lmutil lmremove, etc. On the PC, this is the only way to access the utilities. So where you see, 
for example, the 
lmstat command, read 
lmutil lmstat.
</P>
<P> On a PC, you also have the option of using lmtools if it was included in your distribution package.  lmtools is a Graphic Interface utility with the same functionality as lmutil.
<A NAME="Q11.1"></A></P>
<H2>Q11.1  How do I tell who's currently using a<A NAME="IX59"> feature</A>? </H2>
<P>
Use lmstat. This is a utility shipped to vendors and intended for distribution to end-users. 
</P>
<PRE>% lmstat -a -c <I>license_file_path</I> </PRE>
<P>
will list all the current information available from the server. Note that uncounted licenses are 
NOT reported by lmstat 
 -  only counted licenses. 
<A NAME="Q11.2"></A></P>
<H2>Q11.2  How do I see historical usage of a feature?</H2>
<P>
Correct usage information can be obtained using FLEXadmin's reporting capability.</P>

<A NAME="Q11.3"></A>
<H2>Q11.3  lmstat sometimes skips features, why?</H2>
<P>
This happens for 2 reasons: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Uncounted features (number of licenses = 0) aren't shown by lmstat, since the 
number of users isn't relevant</LI>
<LI>If an uncounted line has a daemon name of `none', there is a bug that lmstat will ignore 
subsequent counted features of the same name. To fix, simply change `none' to a valid 
daemon name.</LI>
</UL>
<A NAME="Q11.4"></A>
<H2>Q11.4  How do I tell if I've typed in the license file <A NAME="IX60">correctly</A>? </H2>
<P>
Use lmcksum (copy lmstat to lmcksum if you can't find lmcksum 
 - See Q8.3). lmcksum -c 
`license-file'. If you have a v4.0+ license file, and the vendor has included `ck=nnn' on the 
FEATURE lines, lmcksum will simply report OK or BAD next to each FEATURE line. 
Otherwise, numbers are reported, and you can ask your supplier to run the same command on 
the original file, and compare numbers. </P>
<A NAME="Q11.5"></A>
<H2>Q11.5   I'm getting `Cannot Connect' errors. How do I determine what's <A NAME="IX61">wrong</A>?</H2>
<P>
Use the lmdiag utility. (If you can't find lmdiag, copy a v4.0+ version of lmstat to lmdiag, and 
you'll have it.) lmdiag will analyze the problem, and, if requested, determine if the problem is 
that the server is running on a different port than indicated in the license file. 
</P>
<P>
lmdiag also prints out a description of the license file in easily understandable English. 
</P>
<P>
In summary, lmdiag attempts a checkout of the feature, and if it fails, reports why. 
<A NAME="Q11.6"></A></P>
<H2>Q11.6  <A NAME="IX62">lmremove</A> doesn't seem to work: after freeing a license, it becomes checked out shortly after. Why? </H2>
<P>
That's because lmremove is not intended to free licenses. It has one purpose: when a client node 
crashes, the license is not freed immediately, and can sometimes take a full day to release the 
license. This is because when the node crashes the networking also fails. </P>
<P>
If you free a license with lmremove for an active process, the application will detect this shortly, 
and re-checkout the license. 
<A NAME="Q11.7"></A></P>
<H2>Q11.7  How do I prevent users at my site from being able to use lmdown? </H2>
<P>Start the server with the lmgrd -x lmdown switch. This disables 
the lmdown command. 
<A NAME="Q11.8"></A></P>
<H2>Q11.8  If I can't use <A NAME="IX63">lmdown</A>, how do I shutdown the servers? </H2>
<P>
In UNIX, use kill, without a flag. DON'T use kill -9. If you use kill without a flag, the server is able to 
shutdown cleanly, the same, in fact, as if lmdown had been used.
</P>
<P>
In Windows, use the stop button under the FLEXlm License Manager in the Control Panel or lmutil lmdown in DOS.  If all fails to shut down, Crtl-Alt-Del, END TASK(not recommended).<A NAME="Q11.9"></A></P>
<H2>Q11.9  When I run lmdown on redundant servers, it doesn't seem to work. Why? </H2>
<P>
With redundant servers, lmdown returns immediately, but the servers, after having received the 
request, wait one full minute before actually shutting down. (This is in order to avoid a race 
condition where a second server would attempt to re-establish quorum with the server that shut 
down.) Be patient, wait the minute, and you'll see it works.
