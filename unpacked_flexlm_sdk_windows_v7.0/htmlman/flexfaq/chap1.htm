<H1>Q1.   Introduction to FLEXlm</H1>
<HR>
<A NAME="Q1.1"></A>
<H2>Q1.1  What is FLEXlm?</H2>
<P>
FLEXlm is the software licensing <I>defacto standard</I>, that allows the 
implementation of a wide variety of licensing policies.</P>
<P>

FLEXlm is <A NAME="IX1">available</A> on 
:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Unix</LI>
<LI>VMS</LI>
<LI>JAVA</LI>
<LI> 
Windows

<UL>
<LI>Windows 3.11</LI>
<LI>Windows for Workgroup 3.11</LI>
<LI>Windows 95/98</LI>
<LI>Windows NT 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0</LI>
<LI>Alpha NT 3.51</LI>
<LI>Netware 3.12 and 4.X</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Networking is required only for floating/concurrent use licenses. 
<A NAME="Q1.2"></A></P>
<H2>Q1.2  What is a license file, vendor daemon, lmgrd, etc.?</H2>
<P>
The following terms are used to describe 
FLEXlm<I></I> concepts and software components:</P>

<A NAME="IX2">VENDOR DAEMON NAME</A>
<BR>
Usually some short form of the Company Name. Each company is guaranteed to have a unique vendor name. Although, some companies have multiple vendor names.
<P><A NAME="IX3">FEATURE
</A><BR>
Any functionality requiring licensing. The meaning of a 
feature will depend entirely on how it is used by each 
application. For example, a feature could 
represent any of the following:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>An application software system consisting of hundreds 
of programs</LI>
<LI>A single program (regardless of version)</LI>
<LI>A specific version of a program</LI>
<LI>A part of a program</LI>
<LI>A piece of data</LI>
</UL>
<P>CLIENT
<BR>
An application program requesting or receiving a license.
</P>
<P><A NAME="IX4">DAEMON</A><BR>
A process that must continuously run in the &quot;background&quot;, and is often designed to respond to requests from other processes across a network.  The word &quot;daemon&quot; is common on UNIX, but not on Windows. Daemon comes form the Greek word &quot;ghost&quot;.  On Windows NT, daemons are called &quot;services&quot;. When services respond to requests, they are known as the &quot;SERVER&quot; half of a client/server architecture. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="IX5">VENDOR DAEMON
</A><BR>
The 
daemon/service/server that dispenses licenses for the requested 
features. This daemon is built by a software provider with FLEXlm libraries supplied by 
GLOBEtrotter Software.
</P>
<P><A NAME="IX6">LMGRD</A><BR>
The 
daemon process, or license server, that directs client 
processes to the correct vendor daemon. The same lmgrd can be shared by 
all applications from all vendors, as this daemon neither 
authenticates nor dispenses licenses. Lmgrd processes few 
user requests on its own, but forwards these requests to 
other daemons (the vendor daemons).
</P>
<P>SERVER NODE
<BR>
 
A computer system running the license server software. 
The server node will contain all site-specific information 
regarding all feature usage. Multiple server nodes used for 
redundancy can logically be considered the<I> server node</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="IX7">LICENSE FILE
</A><BR>
A file distributed with software which enables and restricts the usage of specified features and behaviors. The restrictions can include concurrent usage limits, specific computers by hostid or IP-address, and more.
</P>
<P><A NAME="IX8">LICENSE FILE LIST</A><BR>
A list of license files separated with a colon ':' on Unix and  a 
semi-colon ';' on Windows. A 
<I>license 
file list</I> can be accepted in most places where a license file 
is appropriate. When a directory is specified, all files 
matching 
<I>*.lic</I> in that directory are automatically used, as if 
specified as a list(v6+ only).
</P>
<P><A NAME="IX9">LICENSE KEY </A>
<BR>
A 12- or 20-character hexadecimal number which 
`authenticates' the readable license file text, ensuring that 
the license text has not been modified. 

</P>
<P>LICENSE SERVER
<BR>
The lmgrd and vendor daemon processes. License server 
refers to the processes, not the computer which runs these processes.

<A NAME="Q1.3"></A></P>
<H2>Q1.3  How does FLEXlm work?</H2>
<P>
FLEXlm is a client-server application toolkit. The software/client requests a 
license from the license server and is either granted or denied the license. FLEXlm is also often used simply to &quot;node-lock&quot;, without a license server.  In this case, the license is authenticated by the FLEXlm libraries compiled into the software application.
</P>
<P>

The five main components in 
FLEXlm are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Client library (embedded in the license-managed application)</LI>
<LI><I>lmgrd</I></LI>
<LI>License file</LI>
<LI>Vendor daemon(s)</LI>
<LI>
license administration tools(lmutil, lmdiag, lmstat, etc.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The end-user installs 
<I>lmgrd</I> and the vendor daemon on the computer specified in the licenses. Once 
the license file(s) and the daemons are in place, the only requirement is to start lmgrd. 
The daemon is typically started when the machine boots (in the UNIX &quot;.rc&quot; scripts,  
or on Windows as a system service), but can also be started manually by any user.
