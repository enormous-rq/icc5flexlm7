<H1>Q10.     Common Application Startup Problems</H1>
<HR>
<A NAME="Q10.1"></A>
<H2>Q10.1  Cannot find <A NAME="IX56">license</A> file</H2>
<P>
Most applications have a default location in their application directory hierarchy. You can 
override this with the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable. This problem can occur 
when this variable is set wrong, or the default location for the license is missing.
</P>
<P>The default FLEXlm license file location:
</P>
<P> /usr/local/flexlm/<I>v</I>6.1/<I>platform</I>/license.dat   (UNIX) <BR>
c:\flexlm\license.dat (Windows, NT, OS/2)<BR>
SYS:\SYSTEM\flexlm\license.dat (Netware) <BR>
SYS$COMMON:[SYSMGR] flexlm.dat (VMS)
<A NAME="Q10.2"></A></P>
<H2>Q10.2  No such feature exists</H2>
<P>
The most common reason for this is that you're using the wrong license file, or an outdated copy 
of the file.
<A NAME="Q10.3"></A></P>
<H2>Q10.3  Cannot connect to license server</H2>
<P>
Usually this means the server isn't running. It can also mean the server is using a different copy 
of the license file, which has a different port number than the license file you're currently using 
indicates. You can use the lmdiag utility to more fully analyze this error.
<A NAME="Q10.4"></A></P>
<H2>Q10.4  License server does not support this feature</H2>
<P>
This means the server is using a different copy of the license file than the application. They 
should be synchronized. This error will also report `UNSUPPORTED' in the debug log file. If you're using v5+ applications, add a USE_SERVER line after the SERVER line to fix this.</P>
<A NAME="Q10.5"></A>
<H2>Q10.5  What is <A NAME="IX57">WINSOCKX.DLL</A>?
</H2>
<P>
Winsockx.dll is a dll provided by Globetrotter that is used by 16 bit applications to interface 
between Flexlm and other networking software provided by networking ISV's. It allows 
nodelocked applications to not require networking software. It also interfaces between 
winsock.dll for TCP/IP, and the Novell dll's that provide IPX/SPX on 16 bit operating systems.</P>
