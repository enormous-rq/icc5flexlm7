<H1>Q9.     Common Debug Log errors</H1>
<HR>
<A NAME="Q9.1"></A>
<H2>Q9.1  Retrying socket bind</H2>
<P>
This means the TCP number is already in use port number. Almost always, this means the lmgrd 
is already running, and you've tried to start it twice. Sometimes (rarely) it means that another 
program is using this TCP port number. The number is listed on the SERVER line in the license 
file as the last item. You can change the number and restart lmgrd, but only do this if you don't 
already have an lmgrd running for this license file. This is improved by using the most current <I>lmgrd</I>.
<A NAME="Q9.2"></A></P>
<H2>Q9.2  License manager:<A NAME="IX55"> can't initialize</A>: Cannot find license file</H2>
<P>
You've started lmgrd on a non-existent file. There's 2 ways to specify the file for lmgrd to use:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>-c</B> license-file</LI>
<LI>LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In either case, the license specified doesn't exist.
<A NAME="Q9.3"></A></P>
<H2>Q9.3  <A NAME="IX54">Invalid license key</A> (inconsistent encryption code for `f1')</H2>
<P>
This happens for 3 different reasons:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The license file has been typed in incorrectly (cutting and pasting from email is a safe 
way to avoid this)</LI>
<LI>The license was generated incorrectly. Your license supplier will have to generate a 
new license if this is the case.</LI>
<LI>(Rare): The license vendor changed encryption seeds. This is actually an incorrectly 
generated license, but it may be because the company generating the licenses has, in 
effect, 2 different kinds of license generators. Again, only the license supplier can 
resolve this.</LI>
</UL>
<A NAME="Q9.4"></A>
<H2>Q9.4  <A NAME="IX53">MULTIPLE</A> `vendor-daemon-name' servers running.</H2>
<P>
There's 2 lmgrd and vendor-daemons running for this license file. Only one process per vendor-daemon/per node is allowed by FLEXlm to run. Sometimes this can happen because the lmgrd 
was killed with a -9 signal (which should not be done!). The lmgrd was then not able to bring 
the vendor-daemon process down, so it's still running, although not able to serve licenses. If an 
lmgrd is killed with a -9, the vendor-daemons also then must be killed with a -9 signal. In 
general, lmdown should be used. If kill is used, you should use kill without a -9 argument. Using the most current <I>lmgrd</I> will help this problem.
<A NAME="Q9.5"></A></P>
<H2>Q9.5  Vendor daemon can't talk to lmgrd</H2>
<P>
This means a pre-v3.0 lmgrd is being used with a v3.0+ vendor daemon. Simply use the latest 
version of lmgrd (MUST be a version equal to or greater than the vendor daemon version).
</P>
<P>
(Rare): This can also happen if TCP networking doesn't function on the node where you're 
trying to run lmgrd.
<A NAME="Q9.6"></A></P>
<H2>Q9.6  Vendor daemon died with status n...Since this is an unknown status, lmgrd will attempt to re-start the vendor daemon.</H2>
<P>
Often this is accompanied by printing a port number which increases over and over.
</P>
<P>
lmgrd tries to start the vendor daemon using the VENDOR line in the license file, which looks 
like:
</P>
<PRE>VENDOR demo /usr/flexlm/<I>v</I>6.1/<I>platform</I>/demo</PRE>
<P>
The /usr/flexlm/<I>v</I>6.1/<I>platform</I>/demo is a path to a binary, and there's something wrong with either the path or the 
binary itself. One way to debug this is to run vendor daemon directly, using this path, and 
problem then becomes more apparent.
