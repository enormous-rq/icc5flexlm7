<H1>Q12.     End-User Options File </H1>
<HR>
<P>
Please refer to the End-User manual for a general discussion of the End-User Options file. Only 
exceptional  are answered here. 
<A NAME="Q12.1"></A></P>
<H2>Q12.1  How do I enable the <A NAME="IX64">Options file</A>? </H2>
<P>
Add a path to your Options file to the DAEMON line in the license file: 

</P>
<P>
Before: 
</P>
<PRE>DAEMON xyzd ../daemon_path
</PRE>
<P>
After: </P>
<PRE>DAEMON xyzd ../daemon_path ../options_file_path</PRE>
Refer to END USER MANUAL.
<A NAME="Q12.2"></A>
<H2>Q12.2  Why doesn't <A NAME="IX65">TIMEOUT</A> work? </H2>
<P>
TIMEOUT only works if the application developer specifically supports it. By default, it 
doesn't work. Often, it's a difficult feature to support, since the application has to determine 
when it's `idle', and this is sometimes non-trivial to determine. 
<A NAME="Q12.3"></A></P>
<H2>Q12.3  Is the Options GROUP the same as a Unix group (/etc/groups)?</H2>
<P>
No. GROUPs are defined in the Options file, and are unrelated to Unix groups. 
<A NAME="Q12.4"></A></P>
<H2>Q12.4  I need to have more users in a GROUP - how can I get around the 240 character limitation?</H2>
<P>
Upgrade to v4+ vendor daemons. They support '\' line continuation character, and a GROUP line of up to 2K.  Also use multiple GROUP lines with the same groupname concatenated.
<A NAME="Q12.5"></A></P>
<H2>Q12.5  I need a <A NAME="IX66">GROUP</A> of hosts, not users.</H2>
<P>
Upgrade to v4+ vendor daemons, where HOST_GROUP is supported.
<A NAME="Q12.6"></A></P>
<H2>Q12.6  What is <A NAME="IX67">REPORTLOG </A>for?</H2>
<P>
It's used by FLEXadmin to give an accurate report of historical usage. It's not intended for any 
other use.  This can be enable in the Options File: REPORTLOG <I>filename</I>.
